# Qwitter - A Twitter Clone

This is a twitter clone im actively working on. i made this to learn the fundementals of Express.JS and learn to use more advanced APIs in my project.

## Techstack

### Front End

We Use **React** As The Framework And **NGINX** For A Reverse Proxy To Balance Load. We Also Use **Express.JS** To Host The Files In It.

### Back End

We Use **Express.JS** For The Api With **MongoDB** As The Database. We Also Use **Passport.JS** For Authentication

### Production

For Production Servers, I Will Probably Make A Few Dockerfiles And Create 3 Different Docker Compose Configs, One For An All In One Setup, With The Other Two Being The BackEnd And FrontEnd Seperated.

## Progress

- Backend: 70%
- FrontEnd: 70%
- Docker Deployment Configs: 0%
- NGINX Configs: 0%
